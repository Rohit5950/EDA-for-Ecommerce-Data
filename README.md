# **EDA-for-Ecommerce-Data**

Developed a data-driven project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing using two comprehensive datasets. The first dataset captured customer activity and purchasing patterns on the shopping site, while the second provided demographic, purchase, and marketing insights for a targeted customer group.

Conducted detailed EDA to uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies in customer behavior, such as purchase frequency, cart abandonment rates, and product preferences. Applied statistical hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about customer segments, marketing effectiveness, and the impact of demographic factors on purchasing decisions.

The analysis provided actionable insights into customer engagement, enabling the optimization of marketing strategies, personalized customer targeting, and improved product recommendations, ultimately enhancing conversion rates and customer retention.
